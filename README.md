# OpenAleph Builder for Obsidian

TODO

## Installation

You must have [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) installed in order to use this plug-in.

Your Obsidian app version must be equal or newer `1.13.0`. You can see the version by opening the **Settings** and navigating to the **General** section. If you have an older version of Obsidian, [upgrade to a more recent version](https://obsidian.md/help/updates).

This plug-in can be installed directly via the Obsidian Community plug-ins catalogue. Two other installation methods are detailed below.

### Install using the BRAT plug-in

If you already have the Beta Reviewers Auto-update Tester plug-in (called BRAT), you can add `https://github.com/noop-ptf/OpenAlephBuilder.git` and select the latest version of this plug-in.

### Install from source code

1. Make sure you have NodeJS installed, and that the version is at least v18 (`node --version`). If you don't have NodeJS installed, follow [the official instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Navigate to the plug-ins directory of your Obsidian vault (usually located at `VaultName/.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-id/`). Here, run `git clone https://github.com/noop-ptf/OpenAlephExplore.git`.
3. Navigate into the newly-created directory, that contains the source code, and install the dependencies: `npm i`
4. Run `npm run build`. This should produce three files: `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json`.
5. Open Obsidian, navigate to the **Settings** > **Community plugins** and refresh the list of plug-ins. OpenAleph Builder should appear. Enable it.
